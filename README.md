# Cpp-RL
Implementation of some simple reinforcement learning methods in C++, used to play TicTacToe. Mainly, this was intended to be a training project for C++. Documentation and new functionalities will be added over time, e.g. comparison of differently trained Q-functions, playing against a human etc.

Note:
As this was one of my first little C++-projects, the code looked much more like C, as this was my background. Since then my knowledge of C++ has developed a lot and currently I am updating the code to resemble that fact.
